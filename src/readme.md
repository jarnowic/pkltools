No installation script provided: deploy the binaries somewhere where your `$PATH` points to, copy the modules to your `$HOME` or `$USERPROFILE` space, and set the environment variable `PERL5LIB` to the `PERL5LIB` directory in your home and userprofile directory.

I might add the `install.pl` if someone contributes with one.

Good luck, and happy keyboard layout tweaking.
